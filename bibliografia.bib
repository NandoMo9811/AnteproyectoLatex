abstract = {Background
Research literature on problematic smartphone use, or smartphone addiction, has proliferated. However, relationships with existing categories of psychopathology are not well defined. We discuss the concept of problematic smartphone use, including possible causal pathways to such use.
Method
We conducted a systematic review of the relationship between problematic use with psychopathology. Using scholarly bibliographic databases, we screened 117 total citations, resulting in 23 peer-reviewer papers examining statistical relations between standardized measures of problematic smartphone use/use severity and the severity of psychopathology.
Results
Most papers examined problematic use in relation to depression, anxiety, chronic stress and/or low self-esteem. Across this literature, without statistically adjusting for other relevant variables, depression severity was consistently related to problematic smartphone use, demonstrating at least medium effect sizes. Anxiety was also consistently related to problem use, but with small effect sizes. Stress was somewhat consistently related, with small to medium effects. Self-esteem was inconsistently related, with small to medium effects when found. Statistically adjusting for other relevant variables yielded similar but somewhat smaller effects.
Limitations
We only included correlational studies in our systematic review, but address the few relevant experimental studies also.
Conclusions
We discuss causal explanations for relationships between problem smartphone use and psychopathology.}

In this paper we explore the accuracy of using self-reported estimates when compared with actual smartphone use. We also include source code to process and visualise these data. We compared 23 participants’ actual smartphone use over a two-week period with self-reported estimates and the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale. Our results indicate that estimated time spent using a smartphone may be an adequate measure of use, unless a greater resolution of data are required. Estimates concerning the number of times an individual used their phone across a typical day did not correlate with actual smartphone use. Neither estimated duration nor number of uses correlated with the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale. We conclude that estimated smartphone use should be interpreted with caution in psychological research.},

Recently studies examined mediating psychological constructs accounting for relations between both depression and anxiety with problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity. The aim of the current study was to analyze the fear of missing out (FOMO) as a possible mediator in these relationships.
Method
We recruited 1034 Chinese undergraduate students via a web-based survey that measured smartphone use frequency, PSU, depression, anxiety and FOMO.
Results
Structural equation modeling demonstrated that FOMO was significantly related to smartphone use frequency and PSU severity. FOMO significantly mediated relations between anxiety and both smartphone use frequency and PSU severity. FOMO did not account for relations between depression and smartphone use/PSU.
Conclusion
This is one of the first studies testing FOMO in relation to PSU severity among Asian participants. FOMO may be an important variable accounting for why some types of psychopathology (e.g., anxiety) are associated with PSU.}

ABSTRACT = {Nomophobia is an emerging phenomenon in the 21st century. Consequently, it results in various health problems, both physical and psychological. The following systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to establish the relationship between nomophobia with anxiety, smartphone addiction, and insomnia. To identify the relevant studies, we searched through several databases. Out of the 1523 studies identified, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. After conducting the statistical analysis, the results revealed that anxiety r = 0.31 (95% CI: 0.25 to 0.38), smartphone addiction r = 0.39 (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.75), and insomnia r = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.38 to 0.75) are positively associated with nomophobia. Mobile phone usage has become inevitable, even for individuals who use it to a lesser degree than others, to perform simple tasks, such as communicating with others or for educational purposes. It is crucial to raise awareness about the consequences of overusing these devices, including the physical and psychological complications in both the short and long terms.},

abstract = {Background
The few studies that have investigated the relationship between mobile phone use and sleep have mainly been conducted among children and adolescents. In adults, very little is known about mobile phone usage in bed our after lights out. This cross-sectional study set out to examine the association between bedtime mobile phone use and sleep among adults.
Methods
A sample of 844 Flemish adults (18–94 years old) participated in a survey about electronic media use and sleep habits. Self-reported sleep quality, daytime fatigue and insomnia were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) and the Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS), respectively. Data were analyzed using hierarchical and multinomial regression analyses.
Results
Half of the respondents owned a smartphone, and six out of ten took their mobile phone with them to the bedroom. Sending/receiving text messages and/or phone calls after lights out significantly predicted respondents' scores on the PSQI, particularly longer sleep latency, worse sleep efficiency, more sleep disturbance and more daytime dysfunction. Bedtime mobile phone use predicted respondents' later self-reported rise time, higher insomnia score and increased fatigue. Age significantly moderated the relationship between bedtime mobile phone use and fatigue, rise time, and sleep duration. An increase in bedtime mobile phone use was associated with more fatigue and later rise times among younger respondents (≤ 41.5 years old and ≤ 40.8 years old respectively); but it was related to an earlier rise time and shorter sleep duration among older respondents (≥ 60.15 years old and ≥ 66.4 years old respectively).
Conclusion
Findings suggest that bedtime mobile phone use is negatively related to sleep outcomes in adults, too. It warrants continued scholarly attention as the functionalities of mobile phones evolve rapidly and exponentially.}

abstract = {Results of several studies have suggested that smartphone addiction has negative effects on mental health and well-being. To contribute to knowledge on this topic, our study had two aims. One was to investigate the relationship between risk of smartphone addiction and satisfaction with life mediated by stress and academic performance. The other aim was to explore whether satisfaction with life mediated by stress and academic performance facilitates smartphone addiction. To identify test subjects, systematic random sampling was implemented. A total of 300 university students completed an online survey questionnaire that was posted to the student information system. The survey questionnaire collected demographic information and responses to scales including the Smartphone Addiction Scale - Short Version, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Data analyses included Pearson correlations between the main variables and multivariate analysis of variances. The results showed that smartphone addiction risk was positively related to perceived stress, but the latter was negatively related to satisfaction with life. Additionally, a smartphone addiction risk was negatively related to academic performance, but the latter was positively related to satisfaction with life.}

abstract = {While functional differences between today’s cell phones and traditional computers are becoming less clear, one difference remains plain – cell phones are almost always on-hand and allow users to connect with an array of services and networks at almost any time and any place. The Pew Center’s Internet and American Life Project suggests that college students are the most rapid adopters of cell phone technology and research is emerging which suggests high frequency cell phone use may be influencing their health and behavior. Thus, we investigated the relationships between total cell phone use (N=496) and texting (N=490) on Satisfaction with Life (SWL) in a large sample of college students. It was hypothesized that the relationship would be mediated by Academic Performance (GPA) and anxiety. Two separate path models indicated that the cell phone use and texting models had good overall fit. Cell phone use/texting was negatively related to GPA and positively related to anxiety; in turn, GPA was positively related to SWL while anxiety was negatively related to SWL. These findings add to the debate about student cell phone use, and how increased use may negatively impact academic performance, mental health, and subjective well-being or happiness.}

    abstract = {People spend a large portion of their day interacting with vibrating mobile devices, yet how consumers psychologically respond to haptic feedback from these devices and their effect on consumer decision-making is largely unknown. Integrating recent work on human–computer interaction and reward processing, the current research examines: (1) the relationship between vibration duration and reward response, (2) to what extent rewarding vibrations influence consumer choice, (3) the process by which this effect occurs, and (4) how the effect differs compared to other forms of feedback (visual and audio). We find that mobile vibrations evoke a reward response that is distinct from other forms of feedback, which in turn boosts purchasing in online shopping environments (increased item adds and higher basket totals), and that impulsive consumers tend to be more responsive to mobile vibrations. We examine the impact of mobile vibrations on consumer decision-making in a variety of experimental settings, drawing on a diverse participant pool, leveraging both controlled experiments, and a country-wide field experiment to assess important boundary conditions. These findings have important implications for the ethical design of haptic interfaces in the marketplace and the role of mobile vibrations as a novel form of reward.},
